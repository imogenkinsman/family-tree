# Family Tree

Implemented with Ruby (2.x), with tests written in RSpec.

###Setup

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
The simplest install for OSX would probably be via homebrew, though ordinarily a version manager (such as RVM) would be recommended.
2. Install RSpec: ```gem install rspec```
3. Run tests: ```rspec spec/```
